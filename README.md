The Global Emmison Calculator by Ryan Rana, Amar Shah, and Chris Doss, is the official project of the winter season at WHRHS CS Club. It allows the user to search for any city in the world (or longitude and latitude) and estimate to amount of carbon emmisons in the air, all while displayed it on a beatiful website. The project should be finished and deployed by Febuary. It is currently in the middle stages of implelementing the dataset.
