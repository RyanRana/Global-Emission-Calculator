# Global-Emmison-Calculator

The Global Emmison Calculator by Ryan Rana, Amar Shah, and Chris Doss, is the official project of the winter season at WHRHS CS Club. It allows the user to search for any city in the world (or longitude and latitude) and estimate to amount of carbon emmisons in the air, all while displayed it on a beatiful interface. We are working on deploying as an official website. The dataset can be found with the following link, https://www.kaggle.com/sansuthi/global-co2-emissions.
